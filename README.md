RAS
===

Credits for Standards/Elites of each Division of RAS (Roblox Assault Specialists.). We use this to track your EC (Elite Credits) and to keep track on how active you are. For each successful training you earn 2 Credits. You need around 16 Credits for Elite unless we find you good, then it is only 8-10 Credits.
